# Scripting

[Week 3 Index](week3.md)

## Overview
In this section there are a couple of main concepts that we are going to discuss:
* What are shell scripts?
* Where can scripts and other programs be stored?
* Environment variables
* Login profiles
* Program exit status and control flow

## What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a text file of actions you want the computer to take. The first line, called the "shebang" defines what shell interpreter to be used.

Bash (and other shells) often use whitespace to delimit arguments to programs. Quotations keep arguments with spaces together.

Double quotes and single quotes work differently in bash: double quotes allow expansion of variables and some other kinds of things, whereas single quotes are verbatim.

### Example Script
Following is a simple script we will use as an example in the following sections:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo 'Ooh, so scary!'
```
Please use your command-line editor to copy this into a file named `boo.sh`.

Notice the first line is the "shebang" that starts with a `#!`, followed by the interpreter, which in this case is the bash shell. We then have the `echo` program, which just prints out the argument(s) to the console.

## Helpful Programs
A couple of helpful programs that you may want to use:
| Program | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `echo` | Print statements |
| `hostname` | Name of the server you are logged into |
| `date` | Current date and time (many format options) |

## Executing Shell Scripts
There are two ways to execute shell scripts:

* Invoking it with the appropriate shell
```bash
$ bash boo.sh
Ooh, so scary!
```
* Refer to it as a program directly by its path
```bash
$ ./boo.sh
-bash: ./boo.sh: Permission denied
```
**Quiz:** Why did this happen? What can we do to check the permissions?

??? note "Permission Hint"
    Use the command `ls -l boo.sh` to see the permissions:
    ```bash
    $ ls –l boo.sh
    -rw-r--r-- 1 username student 22 Oct 11 01:44 boo.sh
    ```
??? note "Answer"

    The file `boo.sh` doesn't have the execute bit set, so we can't execute it as a program.

    You can change file and directory permissions using the `chmod` program:
    ```bash
    $ chmod +x boo.sh
    $ ls –l boo.sh
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 username student 22 Oct 11 01:44 boo.sh
    $ ./boo.sh
    Ooh, so scary!
    ```

**Quiz:** How would we remove read permissions on a file for both the file *group* and *others*?

??? note "`chmod` Hint"

    The `chmod` program takes both relative (**[ugo][-+][rwx]**) and absolute (e.g. 700) syntax.

??? note "Answer"

    ```bash
    $ chmod go-r boo.sh
    ```
## Moving Scripts to a Bin Directory
Now that we have an executable shell script, we may want to move it to a directory that contains all our executables, maybe something named `bin`, like was mentioned earlier. We also need to make the new directory discoverable by the shell. We do this using the `PATH` variable, which we will discuss in a minute.

Essentially, the `PATH` variable controls where the shell looks for executables.
```bash
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ mv boo.sh ~/bin/boo
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
$ boo
Ooh, so scary!
```
**Quiz:** Now does it matter if we change directories? What happens if we close the shell and reopen it?

??? note "Answer"

    It doesn't matter if we change directories, but the change to our `PATH` variable is not kept if we close the shell and reopen it.

## Environment Variables
Environment variables are similar to variables in other programming languages. But, they also have some important distinctions that set them apart.

Variables can have a *local* scope (in a script) or a *global* scope (with child processes).

There are three types of variables:

1. Simple
2. Magic
3. Special

### Simple Variables
They are like other programming languages.
Simple assignment:

```bash
x=1
```

There are no types (mostly everything is text)

```bash
y=foo
```

Variables are conventionally uppercase, but it's not necessary.

```bash
NAME="some data"
```

Variables are just dumb text, unlike other programming languages. While there are some exceptions, there are no complex data structures.

```bash
MYDATA=1,2,3
```

And since it's all just text, there's limited syntax.

```bash
OTHER=1+2.3
```

There is also a weird thing where 0 is true and 1 is false, which we will discuss later.

```bash
COND=1
```

Variables also have a scope. If you define a variable, it is only visible in local scope (current script) by default.

```bash
X=true
```

To propagate the variable down to child processes, you need to `export` it.

```bash
export X
```

You can also declare the variable and export it on the same line.

```bash
export THING=0
```

You can also declare multiple variables on one line.

```bash
export THING=0 DATASET=foo.in
```

### Magic Variables
There are a couple of "magic" variables which are not like other programming languages.
```bash
echo $RANDOM
```
Will always give you a random value, even if you set it to be something else.

### Special Variables
There are many different special variables you can use:
| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$0` ... `$99` | x-th argument of script/function |
| `$_` | Last argument of script/function |
| `$@` | All arguments of script/function (whitespace) |
| `$#` | Count of arguments of script/function |
| `$?` | Exit status of last process (more on this later) |
| `$!` | Process ID of last process (more on this later) |

There are also special software/shell environment variables that change the behavior of different things:
| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PATH` | Directories containing programs |
| `MANPATH` | Directories containing manual pages |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | Directories containing shared libraries |
| `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` | Directories containing package configuration |

## Login Profile
As we discussed earlier, the `PATH` variable is reset every time you log into the cluster, or open a new terminal. What if we wanted to have it be modified every time we started a new session? There's a solution for that! It's called a **login profile** Typically, on Linux you would use the `~/.bashrc` file, but on the UNIX system we have on the clusters it's contained in the `~/.bash_profile` hidden file.

There are many things you can put in the login profile to configure your personal session, but three that we are going to talk about are:

1. Aliases
2. Variables
3. Modules (bad)

An alias is a verbatim command substitution that happens on the command line when invoked like a program.
```bash
alias rm="rm -i"
```
Which would make sure that every time you run the `rm` program, it's run in interactive mode.

You can also add variables (like `PATH`) to your login profile.
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```
This will add the newly created `bin` folder in your home directory to the `PATH` variable every time you create a new session.

Something that you should **NOT** do is load modules (especially conda modules) in your login profile. This can mess up the rest of the start-up process and can cause weird errors.

## Exit Status
Successful programs should exit with a zero (0). And any non-zero exit status should be considered an error condition. Often, programs will document the meaning of their different exit status values in their manual page.
```bash
$ boo
Ooh, so scary!
$ echo $?
0
```
Control flow (if-else conditional statements) in shell scripts often hinge on the success or failure of commands. Because of this, 0 means true and 1 (non-zero) means false in the UNIX shell. This is opposite of almost everywhere else.
```bash
$ true
$ echo $?
0
$ false
$ echo $?
1
```
