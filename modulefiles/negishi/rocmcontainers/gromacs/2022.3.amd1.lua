Description
===========
GROMACS is a molecular dynamics application designed to simulate Newtonian
equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. GROMACS
is designed to simulate biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and
nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions. 

This container, based on a released version of GROMACS, is an AMD beta version
with ongoing optimizations. This container only supports up to a 4 GPU
configuration.
