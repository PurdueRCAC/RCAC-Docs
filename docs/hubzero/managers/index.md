# Hub managers

The administrator's guide. A hub manager configures the hub, manages its
members and their access, curates its content, installs and configures
extensions, and keeps the site healthy. Almost all of that happens in the
administrator interface at `/administrator`, which this book walks through
screen by screen.

It is written for whoever ended up running the hub, which is usually not a
full-time administrator: a researcher, a lab manager, somebody who inherited
the site along with three other jobs. So each chapter says what a screen is
for before it says what fields it has, and it says where a change is hard to
undo, reaches people who are already using the hub, or cannot be tried out
first. Where something does not work — an inert button, a dead filter, a
setting nothing reads — it says that too, rather than describing the intention.

This book is not a field-by-field reference; that is the generated
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration/index.md). It is not
about writing code for a hub, which is [Developers](../developers/index.md).

The exception is the first step. [Installing a hub](installing.md) is
being rewritten for the new web installer; everything after a hub is
running is covered here and current.

## Where to start

If the hub is new, read
[The administrator interface](getting-started.md#the-administrator-interface) and then
[The first week with a new hub](getting-started.md#the-first-week-with-a-new-hub). The first
covers the login and the back end's menus; the second is the ordered path
through the choices that are hard to change later — mail, registration,
access, the front page, and the scheduled jobs — with a link to the chapter
covering each. [Configuring](configuring/index.md) has the settings
screens in full.

If the screens make sense one at a time but not together, read
[How a hub fits together](getting-started.md#how-a-hub-fits-together). It is the
mental model the rest of this book takes for granted — the two halves of the
application, how a page is built from a component, a template and its
modules, what lives in the database and what lives on disk, and what a
manager can and cannot break.

If you are taking over a running hub, start with
[Daily maintenance](maintenance/index.md) and
[Users](users/index.md).

If you are here because something has gone wrong, try
[Frequently asked questions](faq.md) first, then the chapter for the
screen in question. A hub that has just become public and is suddenly full of
junk accounts and junk posts wants [Spam](spam.md), which is worth reading
before that happens rather than during.

## In this book

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) — the administrator
    interface and the first configuration.
- [Integrations](advancedsetup.md) — connecting the hub to analytics,
    Google Drive, the rich text editor, and CAPTCHA.
- [Daily maintenance](maintenance/index.md) — approving content,
    support tickets, cron jobs, notices, and tools.
- [Frequently asked questions](faq.md)
- [Configuring](configuring/index.md) — hub settings, components,
    modules, plugins, registration, and authentication.
- [Users](users/index.md) — members, access groups and levels, groups
    and super groups, member import, and user notes.
- [Menus](menus.md)
- [Content](content/index.md) — articles and URLs.
- [Components](components/index.md) — one chapter per component's
    administrative side, from Answers to Wishlist.
- [Extensions](extensions/index.md) — the extension, module, template,
    and plugin managers.
- [Spam](spam.md) — the spam filters and how to tune them.
- [Security](security.md) — hardening the operating system and the
    CMS.

Every parameter you can set is also listed in the generated
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration/index.md).

!!! note
    Where this book gives a default, it is the value a hub installed
    from the shipped data actually has, which is not always the default a
    component's manifest declares — and the generated reference is built from
    those manifests. Where the two disagree, the stored value wins and this book
    says so. Check the setting on your own hub before relying on either.
    The two clearest cases are in
    [Check the default, do not trust it](getting-started.md#check-the-default-do-not-trust-it).
