# Reference

Generated references, rebuilt from the source tree so they cannot drift
from the code. Each is produced by a script under `docs/_tools/docs/`, and the
Pages workflow fails if the committed pages differ from a fresh run.

- [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — every parameter in every
    component's `config/config.xml` and every plugin manifest, with its
    label, type, default, options, and description resolved from the
    language files.
- [REST API](api/index.md) — every endpoint under `/api/`, from the
    `@apiMethod`, `@apiUri`, and `@apiParameter` docblock tags the API
    explorer in `com_developer` also reads.
- [Muse](muse.md) — the console commands and their tasks, from the
    `@museDescription` docblocks.
- [Events](events/index.md) — every event the CMS fires through
    `Event::trigger()`, with its call sites, arguments, and the plugins that
    listen.

To regenerate after changing a manifest, a controller, or a command:

```bash
for g in config muse events api; do python3 docs/_tools/docs/gen_${g}_reference.py; done
python3 gh-pages/build_site.py
```

The narrative counterparts live in the [Developers](../developers/index.md)
book.
