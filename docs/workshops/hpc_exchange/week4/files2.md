#File storage and transfers

[Week 4 Index](week4.md)

There are many places you can store your files to access them on the clusters:

## Local (mountable)
* `/home`
* `/depot`
* `/scratch`
* `/tmp`

## Indirect access
* `Fortress` (HPSS tape archive)
* `Ceph` (S3 object storage)

## Cloud
* Box.com / REED (retires soon)
* SharePoint
* GitHub (github.itap.purdue.edu)

## Libraries
* PURR - research data repository providing data management, DOI, citation tracking

Of these, only the **Local** and **Indirect access** options are directly available/mounted onto the clusters. The **Cloud** and **Libraries** are good places to store your files, but require more steps to get onto the clusters.

## Home directory
### Environment variable
`$HOME`
### Path
`/home/username`

Your home directory is small (only 25GB), it has mild performance and is cluster specific (it is shared between nodes of a cluster, but not across clusters). It is also mountable on your local computer as a network drive.

Home directories are housed on redundant hardware, are never purged and are protected by snapshots. They are private to each user (they cannot be accessed by other members of your research group)

Home directories are good for personal configuration files, software installation, scripts, etc. You can also store personal data and job files, if they're small enough. It's ok to run jobs against your home directory, but it's not good for heavy I/O scenarios. In short, it's good for medium to long term storage.

## Depot directory
### Path
`/depot/<group_name>`

The Data Depot is a group directory mounted on all Purdue community clusters. It is larger than your home directory (100GB free trial) and it can grow in 1TB increments at $70/TB/year. It has reasonable performance with redundant hardware that is never purged and is protected by snapshots.

It is mounted on all clusters, so you see the same data no matter which cluster you're using. You can also mount it as a network drive on your local computer.

It is owned by the PI of the group and is shared by group members. It also offers fine-grained access controls.

Importantly, you can use the data depot without any cluster purchase, if you need somewhere persistent to store your data.

The Data Depot is good for shared configuration files, software installation, scripts, etc. You can store critical research data here to be shared amongst your group. It's ok to run jobs against but it's not good for intensive I/O scenarios. It is good for medium to long term storage.

## Scratch directory
### Environment variable
`$CLUSTER_SCRATCH`, or `$SCRATCH`, or `$RCAC_SCRATCH`
### Path
`/scratch/<cluster>/username`

Your scratch directory is a high-performance directory on each cluster. It is huge (100+TB), however it does have a file number limit (in the millions), so make sure to not have a bunch of tiny files, use the `tar` and `zip` programs to bundle files together. It is highly performant, but cluster specific, in that it is shared across nodes in a cluster, but not across clusters. It is also mountable as a network drive on your local computer.
It is also private per user, other members of your group cannot access it.

The scratch system is internally redundant, so you don't have to worry about hardware failure corrupting your data, but files are not recoverable if deleted. It is also regularly purged of older files.

Scratch directories are good for intermediate to massive data I/O, so are perfect for data intensive jobs. It is **NOT** for the primary copy of your data or software. And it is **NOT for long-term storage.** It is only for short-term storage of intermediate results.

!!! warning

    Beware of regular purging of older files. You can use the `purgelist` program to  tell you which files will be purged. Please do not try to game the system, as we will ban users who repeatedly do so. Just back older files up to Fortress instead of storing them on Scratch.

## Temporary directory
### Path
`/tmp`

There is a node-local `/tmp` directory on Purdue's community clusters. It is moderately large (200+GB) with good performance. However, there is zero redundancy and files are purged after your job on the node ends. There are no snapshots of data in the `/tmp` directory.

It is node-local, i.e. each node of the cluster has its own `/tmp` that is world-readable (and sort of writable). It is what researchers used to use before the Scratch directory.

It is good for node-local caching of data and files. It is **NOT** for valuable data or software and **NOT** for long-term storage. It is rarely needed, but priceless when you do need it. Unless you understand the tradeoffs, consider just using your Scratch directory.

## Fortress (HPSS tape archive)

### Path

`/home/username`

`/group/<group-name>`

Fortress is our IBM HPSS system for long-term storage. It is huge (25PB) and is free up to a point. It's a tape system with a robotic arm. Its disk cache makes *writes* fast, but *reads* slow.

It is replicated, redundant, and never purged. It is accessible from all clusters with specialized command-line tools, as well as mountable as a network drive for external machines. All Data Depot groups get a `/group` Fortress directory.

Fortress is good for backing up (archiving) critical research data. It is good at storing large files **NOT for many small files**. It is **NOT** for running jobs against. It is made as a slow, long-term storage for your critical data.

We have used the `myquota` command before, but let's run it again to get started

```bash
$ myquota
Type     Location     Size    Limit    Use   Files   Limit      Use
===================================================================
home     username    809KB   25.0GB  0.00%      -       -        -
scratch  username     36KB  200.0TB  0.00%      0k  2,000k    0.00%
```

To access Fortress and move files to/from it,
use the `hsi/htar` programs. Use `hsi` interactively
(similar to using `sftp`, with `ls, cd, get/put, ...`)

```bash
$ hsi
***************************************************************************
**  No Fortress keytab found in your home directory.  Creating one now.  **
***************************************************************************

...
[Fortress HSI]/home/username->
```

!!! note

    The HSI interface is not a true shell and only allows limited commands. It also doesn't allow for tab-completion.

We can use `hsi` to navigate the tape archive system. We can create, remove, rename, and directories "like normal". While in the `hsi` interface, use the `help` program for a listing of commands and what they do. Outside of the `hsi` interface, you can run `hsi help` to get the same information.

```bash
[Fortress HSI]/home/username->ls

[Fortress HSI]/home/username->mkdir example
mkdir: /home/username/example

[Fortress HSI]/home/username->cd example
[Fortress HSI]/home/username/example->ls -lh
```

Now let's remove the directory that we just created, we don't need it cluttering up our file system:

```bash
[Fortress HSI]/home/username/example->cd ..
[Fortress HSI]/home/username->rm -r example
Unknown option or missing argument: 'r' ignored
*** Warning: '/home/carls113/example' is a directory - ignored
```

**Quiz:** Why can't we remove this directory with `rm -r`? What command do we need to remove a directory?

??? note "Answer"

    `rmdir example`

Use `hsi put` and `hsi get` to copy data to and from the tape archive. Let's add our directory to the archive and try to get it back.

```bash
[Fortress HSI]/home/username->put -R example-data
put 'example-data/paper.txt' : paper.txt
```

!!! note

    Without specifying otherwise, we are operating with respect to our home directories (on both archive and cluster).

To exit the `hsi` interface, use the `exit` command.

```bash
[Fortress HSI]/home/username-> exit
username@loginXX.CLUSTER:[~] $
```

You can also use `hsi` commands in one shot without logging in first. Try removing the `example-data` directory from the cluster and then bringing it back with `hsi get`. To be extra safe, we will rename it here instead of actually deleting the directory and its contents.

```bash
$ mv example-data backup

$ hsi get -R example-data
Username: username UID: 143856 Acct: 143856(143856) Copies: 1 COS: 0 Firewall:
get '/home/username/example-data/paper.txt' :
'/home/username/example-data/paper.txt' ...
```

!!! warning

    Be sure you already have the data on Fortress before deleting it from your home directory!

Instead of using `hsi` command to get and put files, we shouldn't store all these smaller files separately. The tape archive is most efficient with large archive formats and has special capabilities with the `.tar` format.

### Transferring data to and from Fortress
You can bundle and send the whole directory in one stream with the `htar` program.:

```bash
$ htar -cvf example-data.tar example-data/
HTAR: a  example-data/
HTAR: a  example-data/paper.txt
...
```

In the example above, the options to the `htar` program are similar to the `tar` program. Execpt, we don't need to compress it using `gzip` (with the `z` flag).

!!! note

    There is no need to make and compress this `.tar` archive ahead of time. Fortress has built-in compression.

## Slurm output files

In our job script, we can use certain Slurm options to specify a path for the console output files in our job. These options are `-o/--output` (for `stdout` and `-e/--error` (for `stderr`). Output paths can contain substitution patterns like `%j` or `%A`. See the *file pattern* section of the *manual page* for details.

So, our example job submission script might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
#SBATCH -J example
#SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:10:00
#SBATCH -o ~/example.out

module load conda
python example.py
```

??? note "Numpy again"

    If you faced the Numpy problem before, we need to again activate the Conda environment we created to have Numpy available.

    ````bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
    #SBATCH -J example
    #SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:10:00
    #SBATCH -o ~/example.out

    module load conda
    conda activate example
    python example.py
    ````

Once that runs, we can check to see the status of the job with `squeue --me`. Once it finishes running, we can check the output file to make sure it does what we expect:

```bash
$ sbatch example.sh
Submitted batch job 2095574
$ cat ~/example.out
2499.9118
```

**Quiz:** If we run the job a second time, will it overwrite the output file? If so, what other options exist?

??? note "Answer"

    It will overwrite it. There are many options available, like job name, job ID, and so on. Use `man sbatch` to find out what these options are.

We can implement our basic knowledge of UNIX programs to isolate our job and save outputs to the tape archive. There isn't a "right" or "wrong" way ere, but this version of the submission file illustrates some good ideas with job behavior:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
#SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:10:00

module load conda

mkdir -p ${SCRATCH}/example
cd ${SCRATCH}/example

cp ~/example.sh ~/example.py ./
python example.py > results.out

cd ..
htar -cvf example.tar example/
```

??? note "Numpy again"

    If you faced the Numpy problem before, we need to again activate the Conda environment we created to have Numpy available.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
    #SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:10:00

    module load conda
    conda activate example

    mkdir -p ${SCRATCH}/example
    cd ${SCRATCH}/example

    cp ~/example.sh ~/example.py ./
    python example.py > results.out

    cd ..
    htar -cvf example.tar example/
    ```

Here, there's two places we need to check for the output of our job. First is the `scratch` space that our job ran in:

```bash
$ sbatch example.sh
Submitted batch job 2095583
$ cat $SCRATCH/example/results.out
2499.9118
```

Then, we also need to check that our `example.tar` file was created on Fortress:

```bash
$ hsi ls
/home/username:
example-data/   example-data.tar   example.tar
```
